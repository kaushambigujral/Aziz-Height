# Aziz Height!
Through inattention, habit or fatigue, drivers ram trucks and trailers into overpasses. Not only does the impact bring integrity issues to the driver, overpass, truck, trailer and cargo into question, the crash can cause traffic jams and other knock-on effects for months after.

Solution? Give drivers a pre-emptive alert that a looming overpass is too low for their load.
